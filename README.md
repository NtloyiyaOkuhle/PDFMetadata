# PDFMetadata
This script is designed to extract metadata from a PDF file. Metadata is essentially data about data, which in this case means information about the PDF file such as its title, author, and creation date.

To use the script, you will need to have Python installed on your computer. Once you have Python installed, you can save the script to your computer as a Python file (with a .py file extension).

To run the script, open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where the script is saved. Then, type the command "python" followed by the name of the script file (e.g. "python metadata_script.py") and press enter.

When the script runs, it will prompt you to enter the path to the PDF file you want to extract metadata from. Once you enter the path, the script will extract the metadata from the file and display it in the terminal window.

The metadata that is extracted includes the title of the PDF, the name of the author, the contributors, the subject, the description, the creation date, the modification date, and the event dates. If the PDF file has any custom properties, those will also be displayed.
